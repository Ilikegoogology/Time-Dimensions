# Time Dimensions

**Time Dimensions** is an incremental game where you start at nothing (the Big Bang) and work your way through different units of time, such as Planck times and Yoctoseconds. As you progress, you unlock automation features and achievements.

## Features

- **Add 1 Planck Time**: Increment your time by 10^-43.
- **Automate Planck Times**: Automatically add Planck times at a rate of 7e5 Planck times per nanosecond. Unlocks an additional button to add Yoctoseconds.
- **Achievements**:
  - "There is no way" – Get a Planck time
  - "Computing?" – Automate Planck Times
  - "ITS BLUE ITS BLUE IT'S BLUE!!" – Get 4e-23 time
  - "This doesn't exist" – Get 999 Yoctoseconds

## Notations

- **Scientific**: `n*10^m`
- **Engineering**: `ne+m` (or `ne-m`)
- **Logarithmic**: Uses logarithms to display time
- **Big Crunch**: Shows how close you are to Big Crunch (only visible after reaching 1e308)
- **Mixed Scientific**: Big Crunch + Scientific
- **Mixed Engineering**: Big Crunch + Engineering
- **Mixed Logarithmic**: Big Crunch + Logarithmic

## Controls

- **Add 1 Planck Time**: Click to increment time by 10^-43.
- **Automate Planck Times**: Click to start automating Planck Times. A new button to add Yoctoseconds will appear.
- **Switch Notation**: Automatically switches between different notations (Scientific, Engineering, Logarithmic, Big Crunch, Mixed Scientific, Mixed Engineering, Mixed Logarithmic).
- **Options**: Configure save options and update rate.

## Options

- **Notations**: Choose how time is displayed (Scientific, Engineering, Logarithmic, Big Crunch, Mixed Scientific, Mixed Engineering, Mixed Logarithmic).
- **Save Options**: Import, Export, and Save your progress.
- **Update Rate**: Adjust how often the game updates (minimum 33ms, maximum 1s).

## Achievements

Achievements are shown in a 12x16 box. Achieved achievements turn from grey to green.
